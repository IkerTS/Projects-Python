User interface built with Tkinter in Python to manage a database of students in Catalan.
The interface has fields to enter the first name, last name and date of birth of a student. 
Then, there are buttons to add, delete and modify students, as well as to export the data to Excel and PDF. 
You can also filter students by different fields such as first name, last name, etc.
